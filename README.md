# Diabetes Prediction  

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes using **Logistic Regression** with two different approaches:  

- **Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb**: Implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch (hand-coded with NumPy).  
- **Diabetes_Prediction_With_Sklearn.ipynb**: Implementation using `scikit-learn` with advanced techniques (e.g., StandardScaler, Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna).  

Both notebooks include:  
- Data preprocessing and visualization (EDA).  
- Model training and evaluation with metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).  
- Visualization of the Loss Curve during training.  

The project provides a clear comparison between a manual implementation and a professional library-based approach for solving a classification problem.
