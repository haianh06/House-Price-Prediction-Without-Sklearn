# House Price Prediction  

This project aims to predict house prices using **Linear Regression** with two different approaches:  

- **House_Price_Prediction.ipynb**: Implementation of Linear Regression from scratch (hand-coded).  
- **House_Price_Prediction_With_Sklearn.ipynb**: Implementation using `scikit-learn` with advanced techniques (e.g., Ridge Regression, Polynomial Features, Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna).  

Both notebooks include:  
- Data preprocessing and visualization (EDA).  
- Model training and evaluation with metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²).  
- Visualization of predicted vs actual prices.  

The project provides a clear comparison between a manual implementation and a professional library-based approach.
